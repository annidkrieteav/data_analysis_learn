**List of projects:**
1. [Taxi in NYC](https://github.com/annidkrieteav/data_analysis_learn/blob/main/taxi_in_nyc.ipynb) -- analising NYC taxi orders with Pandas. Read_csv, rename, groupby, agg, query, sort_values, idxmax, idxmin, value_counts, pivot methods were used for **Exploratory Data Analysis**.
2. [Hotel Bookings](https://github.com/annidkrieteav/data_analysis_learn/blob/main/hotel_bookings.ipynb) -- analising hotel bookings with Pandas. Read_csv, info, rename, groupby, agg, query, sort_values, idxmax, idxmin, value_counts, pivot methods were used for Exploratory Data Analysis. Customers **Churn rate** was calculated.  
3. [User Logs](https://github.com/annidkrieteav/data_analysis_learn/blob/main/user_logs.ipynb) -- analising customers data. Finding the most popular platform and the most active users. Visualizing data with **Seaborn** distplot, barplot and countplot methods.       
4. [Taxi in Peru](https://github.com/annidkrieteav/data_analysis_learn/blob/main/taxi_peru.ipynb) -- analising  taxi orders in Peru with Pandas. An Exploratory Data Analysis was performed. Drivers' score, passengers' score, **DAU** and **MAU** metrics were calculated and plotted with Seaborn.   
5. [Raw Data Handling](https://github.com/annidkrieteav/data_analysis_learn/blob/main/raw_data_handling.ipynb) -- creating dataframe from a set of csv-files stored in various folders. Practicing Python skills to **automate data handling**.  
6. [Retail in Germany](https://github.com/annidkrieteav/data_analysis_learn/blob/main/retail_in_germany.ipynb) -- having a dataset with purchases of clients from Europe. Count basic **sales statistics** for clients from Germany. Duplicated, drop_duplicates, groupby, agg, query, sort_values, assign, quantile and str methods were used for Exploratory Data Analysis. 
7. [Error in Transactions Data](https://github.com/annidkrieteav/data_analysis_learn/blob/main/error_in_transaction_data.ipynb) -- we've found and corrected an error while analising a dataset with transactions. Plotting data in logarithmic scale, converting data to datetime format as well as implementing describe, isna, sum, value_counts, groupby, agg, query, sort_values, rename, min, max and **pivot** methods were used for Exploratory Data Analysis.   
8. [Avocado Price](https://github.com/annidkrieteav/data_analysis_learn/blob/main/avocado_price.ipynb) -- comparing avocado average, simple **moving average** and exponential weighted average price values. Categorizing delay data and labeling it. Plotting results with help of subplots and interactive **Plotly** plots.  
9. [Ads Campaign](https://github.com/annidkrieteav/data_analysis_learn/blob/main/ads_campaign.ipynb) -- plotting data in logarithmic scale to find the type of data distribution, finding ad_id with an anomalistic number of views. Comparing average and simple moving average views data. Calculating clients' registration to publishing ad conversion rate (**CR**). Categorizing clients' registration data and labeling it. Plotting results with help of interactive Plotly plot.  
10. [Visits by Browser](https://github.com/annidkrieteav/data_analysis_learn/blob/main/visits_by_browser.ipynb) -- analising web-site visits. Defining proportion of real users and visits by bots. Finding the most popular browser for users and for bots. Bar-plotting results, downloading data using **Google Docs API** and merging it to our dataframe. Read_csv, groupby, agg, query, sort_values, pivot, fillna, assign and merge methods were used for Exploratory Data Analysis.
